title: Unlog the power
tags:

While working on a project I wanted to see the recent commits to create a proper release. But if you ever ran `git log` you may know that it's bare output is pretty messy. After a short research I found some helpful flags and formatting, that I want to share and explain so you can finally use the power of the log on the cli too.
