title: On a word about branch naming
tags: [short, opinion, git]

As you probably have noticed there has been a discussion about the naming schemes of branches in the last weeks following the BLM-protests. I think I'm not the moral instance on judging if it's ethical justifiable to have your main branch named "master" or not but since my first `git init` I've had my thoughts about the naming and I have to say that I'm pretty happy about the latest movements on this topic.

# Descriptivity

When I work on projects I try to keep my naming as descriptive as possible (I know that those words will probably backfire... We all have our `const dontBotherItllWork`) and so when I started using git I often read or heard the term >master is the main branch and I was always thinking why it was very rarely simply named `main`. A much nicer idea, which I'll follow in all of my future repos, is naming the main branch `trunk`. The beuty is that I don't think I have to explain this. And that's what I mean when I say (and try to use) _descriptive terms_. 


At the end of the day it's up to you which terms you use and why, so be kind and have a nice day.
