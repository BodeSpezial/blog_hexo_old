title: Hello World
---

Hello and welcome to a new start. At least for me. I tried blogging in the past multiple times but for now never sticked to it long enough. But the times between the retries are getting shorter and the amount of frustration I have writing the blog is lower than ever (I guess... It's just because I'm finally writing on a very simple interface on my local machine in a workflow that doesn't annoy the heck out of me).

## What is going on here?

Honestly... I can't and won't tell right now. Not because it's a secret or anything but because I don't now either. I just like to share ideas and communicate and hope that I can, at least from time to time, provide some help, share something useful or at least lighten up your day.

## Why is this going on?

Well if the line(s) above aren't reason enough... I guess because now one has stopped me so far. The internet is broad and lives, imo, from collaboration. And if everyone is all the time thinking: _Is this really something that people might want to see/use/read/hear_ I think we would have a much more boring world. If you read this and are thinking about doing something similar: I strongly encourage you to do so! The world may not __need__ every single blog that's ever written but if no one ever tries we'll never no. Wow.. I guess I start selling motivational cups now.. But seriously! If you want to share, do it! Someone out there might be looking for exacty this article you have in mind! If you have thought about it, the probability is, as far as I think based on experience, that someone else did too.

## When is this going on?

Well, I hope to write at least one post per month for now but I genuinely don't know. Whis me luck and use my (hopefully already configured at the time you are reading this) rss-feed to stay updated.

## Is it possible to support you?

Wait? Really? I truly did not expect you to think that so early but as you may have seen in the form of some sort of icon or banner I am bold enough to already have got you the oppotunity to [buy me a tea]().


So! I hope you have a nice day and that I keep writing.
