I'm now using the command line in my daily life for about a year. Before starting my job as a softare developer I was just casually using Windows and didn't really care about the (as I thought about it then) hypertechnical stuff like Linux, the command-line and all that. But then I fell in the hole of needing it on a regular basis and was addicted to the speed in no time.

## Let's take a step back
I remember not really liking the experience of working on my several-years-old PC. And I never really grasped why but it just didn't felt intuitive to me. I always wanted to open programs with just 'thinking about it' and have a clean desktop.

## First steps
As I said I then begun a job as a software dev because the job I was doing at that time really annoyed me and I liked to fiddle a bit around with the tools that I could easily access like writing some html, css and js on my phone during the breaks.
