Having now watched over two months of protesting following the murder of George Floyd I think a lot of us have had some thoughts about the discussion and the actions of th eopposing sites. One thing that was very controversial was the tearing down of statues and monuments. The protesters and their supporters said that they worship slaveholders and cruelties from the past that shouldn't be praised. Critics of this argued that we can't just forget our history and that the monuments are an important part of remembering the cruel times too to prevent the repetition of the same crimes.
